I am a programmer and data analyst at Washington State University's [Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources](http://csanr.cahnrs.wsu.edu), where I use R, python, and SQL to create data visualizations, perform statistical analysis, and process large amounts of data.

I'm primarily interested in statistical learning and causal inference, especially in the melding of machine learning and economics, behavior prediction, and what can be done with ubiquitous computing. I've developed a couple of relevant R packages: [rnassqs](https://github.com/potterzot/rnassqs) for accessing the NASS QuickStats API from R, and [rkclass](https://github.com/potterzot/rkclass) for instrumental variables regressions.

I'm semi-active on [twitter](http://www.twitter.com/potterzot) and most of my code is available on [my github repository](http://www.github.com/potterzot).

I also write short stories, some of which are available [here](/fiction).
