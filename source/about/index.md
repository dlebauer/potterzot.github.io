Really, the only thing about me is the way that I walk.

I'm interested in causal inference, statistical learning, and predictive analytics, especially as applied to decision making, agriculture, and technology. I'm a strong advocate of open science and efforts to improve access to data, code, and research. In general I feel that patents are too restrictive, that copyright is too long, and that open source sharing models are the way of the future.

I currently work at WSU with some kind of research title. I develop data visualizations and statisticaly analysis, and do a fair amount of data processing. I'm currently working on some climate change agriculture decision making packages. The tools of my trade are R, python, d3js, and SQL. I also enjoy working with Julia, though I don't use it much.

Previously I worked at the National Bureau of Economic Research doing statistical analysis with Stata and I spent two years in the Peace Corps in Guinea and Niger, working with teenagers to start micro-enterprises.

In my pre-Peace Corps life I worked in economic policy analysis, where I attempted to answer complex questions such as: Did the Santa Fe Living Wage law affect employment? Do state retirement programs contribute to the economy? What are the impacts of arts and culture on economies?

I hold a B.A. in Economics and a M.S. in Applied Mathematics.

I am a deep-diving project worker, by which I mean that I tend to get ludicrously involved in a project and forget to come up for air. This kills the researcher... But really, I do like to focus deeply on a problem until it is solved.
